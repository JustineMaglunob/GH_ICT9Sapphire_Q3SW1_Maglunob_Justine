			<td class="table-primary text-primary">Yugo: One of the Original 6 Eilatropes, from the cosmic dance from the Eilatrope Goddess and the Great Dragon and was the King of the Eilatrope people before he was reborn, Lived with his adoptive father when he was reborn as a baby and seperated from his family and venture out to find his family when he discovered his Alien God-like powers, the Power of the Eilatrope. Powers include portals, Portal beam, Wakfu control, Wakfu Weapons(P.S Wakfu is like their magic or mana) and Semi-Immortality and Reincarnation(Yes they can die but they would just go back as a dofus or their egg that they shared with thier Dragon brother.)</td>

			<td class="table-success text-success">Princess Amalia Sheran Sharm: Came from a tribe of plant controlling tribe and is the next ruler of the Sadida Kingdom, and she has connection with a doll that is actually one vessal for the Sadida Goddess, and best friends with Evagelyne and has romantical feelings for Yugo.</td>

		<tr>
			<td class="table-danger text-danger">Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove(Nickname Dally[My favorite Character]): Dally or Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove a tribe that punch first and ask question never, The Iop tribe and Iop job is to be a Shushu Guardian, Shushu are demon like creature that the Iop tribe have to capture and use them as a vessal for their weapons, Dally's Shushu is called Rubilax at 1st were not in good terms as normal but came around and now are allies and have a brother like bond with Yugo and Rubilax and married to Evangelyne and have 3 children, Dally is no ordinary Iop he is the reincarnation of the Iop God and he found out during his fight to save the world but cost his arm...and the one who told him is his master Goultard that is actually the old Iop Gods son so Dallys master is actually his own son. He also have enhanced strength, speed, and stamina with his Demi-God powers and training to be a Shushu Guardian. With his enhanced physical prowess his Godly Nature is increased that more than a 100x was able to lift off the kingdom of Sadida. He also is an expert to hand-to-hand Combat and Swordmanship Specialist make sense because Rubilax was a sword that can change to any element that Dally Chose. He also have Shushu possessing that lets Rubilax take control and possess his body to be stronger and faster but at 1st had problems with it because Rubilax was before didn't respect Dally so he normally go on a rampage but after that it was better and Rubilax fused with Dally to replace his missing hand after the fight to save the world. He also have an Iop instinct basically they go with thier guts and not with their mindsbut some can achieve a state where they have virtually no cognitive thought and react on pure instinct. When Rubilax threatened to hurt Evangelyne, Percedal went into this state and fought all of Rubilax's drones and defeated them all single-handed without receiving a single wound in return because the one thought on his mind was defeating Rubilax so he could not hurt the girl he loves, but he is also smart but during in battles only. 	</td>
